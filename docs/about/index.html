      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I am an undergraduate <a href="https://cse.nd.edu/">computer science</a> student at the <a href="https://www.nd.edu/">University of Notre Dame</a> graduating in 2022. Outside of my studies I spend much of my time at the pool playing for the Notre Dame <a href="http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/">men&rsquo;s water polo team</a>. Originally, I am from the Bellevue/Eastside area of Seattle, where I attended <a href="https://www.eastsidecatholic.org/">Eastside Catholic School</a> and graduated in 2018. I am also a proud alumni of the <a href="https://www.teamunify.com/team/onsbcst/page/home">Bellevue Club Swim Team</a>, where I swam since 9 years old until I graduated high school. Since leaving for college my family moved to the Bay Area so that is where I reside while on breaks. While at Notre Dame I live in <a href="https://fisher.nd.edu/#/">Fisher Hall</a>, and spend much of my time in room B010 (better known as coder quad) working on school work and other CS projects.</p>
<p>This website primarily exists as a platform for sharing code and projects that I am working on, although I may blog about other things which I find interesting.</p>
<h1 id="interests">Interests</h1>
<p>I have many interests both related and unrelated to my studies, by no means is the following an exhaustive list, but I have done my best to include as many as I can.</p>
<h2 id="tech">Tech</h2>
<p>My interests in computer science and technology are evolving quickly as I continue to discover more aspects of the field while completing my degree, but these are some things which I have taken a liking to thus far.</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux/Unix: My <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp20/">systems programming</a> class at Notre Dame has introduced me to many tools in linux/unix which I have found to be interesting/useful. I am beginning to try and get more involved with this type of stuff by working with <a href="https://ndlug.org/">ND Linux Users Group</a> and just messing around with linux in my free time.</li>
<li>Apple: I have always loved Apple products (go ahead, call me a fan boy) and enjoy the perfectly synchronized workflow between my macbook, iphone, and ipad pro. Somewhat conflicting with my emerging interest in Linux is my strong preference for mac OS, in fact in 2015 I built a <a href="https://www.tonymacx86.com/">hackintosh</a> because I love mac OS so much!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sports">Sports</h2>
<p>There are several sports and teams which I follow with varying degrees of intensity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Water Polo: I pay attention to the US national team and as previously mentioned I play for Notre Dame.</li>
<li>Swimming: Do not pay as much attention as I used to when I was still competing in high school, but many of my Bellevue Club teammates swim in NCAA now so I try to keep up with how they are doing. Of course, I stay up to date with the US national team as well.</li>
<li>College Football: I go to Notre Dame so this should be somewhat self explanatory. I also have a favorite <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNtc2lx3pSY">hype video</a>.</li>
<li>NFL: I am a huge Seahawks fan and look forward to Pete Carroll, Russell Wilson, and John Schneider leading us to another Super Bowl victory.</li>
<li>NBA: Not as important to me as the &lsquo;hawks but I do consider myself a Lakers fan.</li>
<li>NHL: The NHL is coming to Seattle!</li>
<li>MLB: I don&rsquo;t have the attention span to watch baseball.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other">Other</h2>
<p>Outside of my primary interests in technology and sports, I do have other interests to fill the remainder of my time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Reddit: I enjoy browsing reddit on a somewhat regular basis. Some of my favorite subreddits are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/">r/dataisbeautifuli</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/">r/IAmA</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/">r/tifu</a>, and many more.</li>
<li>Stocks: While I try not to pay too much attention to the ups and downs of the market, I can&rsquo;t help but keep tabs on my shares of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?tbm=fin&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03Pp1HW2qMpSEtBF9DZI1G1dQpUKg:1584860736269&amp;q=NASDAQ:+TSLA&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNkrMzCnMqeBax8vg5Brs4BlophAT7OAIAxPKUqEkAAAA&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=821#scso=_VQ53Xr6HBIG6-gSO_4i4AQ1:0">$TSLA</a>.</li>
<li>Human Performance: This is somewhat related to sports and tech again but I find anything related to optimizing human performance to be interesting. Whether it is biomechanics for swimming, sports analytics (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moneyball_(film)">moneyball</a>), or even just optimizing mental concentration (my favorite tool for this is <a href="https://www.brain.fm/">brain.fm</a>), then I am likely interested in it.</li>
</ul>
