        <p>After 7 semesters, I can finally call myself a Notre Dame alum!</p>
<p>There have been so many memories made these past few years, from some of the awesome football wins we&rsquo;ve had (especially thinking about the 2020 Clemson game) to the amazing friends I&rsquo;ve met in <a href="https://fisher.nd.edu/#/">Fisher</a> and on <a href="http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/">water polo</a>.
Of course, it was not all easy.
Between Covid, difficult classes, and the cold weather, there were plenty of struggles, but it was all worth it and I could not have asked for a better college experience.</p>
<p>Due to several circumstances I wound up a bit ahead on my credits and made the decision to graduate a semester early with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
I&rsquo;ll still walk with my classmates in May 2022, and plan to stay in South Bend with my college roommates during the spring 2022 semester.
Since the company I&rsquo;m working for, <a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a>, is fully remote I&rsquo;m able to sort of continue living the college life until May graduation while still getting a head start on my career and will start working for them in January.
After my college friends graduate, I plan to move to New York City with them some time early fall or late summer of 2022.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve completed my degree, here&rsquo;s a list of all the classes I took.</p>
