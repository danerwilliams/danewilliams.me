        <p>A few months ago, I saw on Linkedin that a fellow <a href="https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme">vampire</a>, <a href="https://zenorocha.com/">Zeno Rocha</a> had started a new job at a startup called <a href="https://workos.com/">WorkOS</a>.
He said the team was looking to bring on more software engineers and developer experience engineers, so I scheduled a call and learned more about the company from him.</p>
<p>I quickly became very impressed by what Zeno had shared with me about the company as well as from the research I had done and began the interview process.
I&rsquo;ve always loved building tools for other developers, therefore I thought that going to a company that makes API&rsquo;s seemed like an awesome opportunity.
After meeting many more members of the team and going through multiple interview rounds I finally had an offer and could not have been more excited to join.</p>
<p>Working in an organization of this size that is getting ready to grow incredibly fast is an exceptionally unique opportunity and I&rsquo;m sure I will have virtually unlimited opportunities to learn and grow while making an impact on the company.
I&rsquo;ll be joining as the 9th engineering hire and can&rsquo;t wait to get started in January after I graduate from Notre Dame.
So stoked to share more about this awesome experience!</p>
