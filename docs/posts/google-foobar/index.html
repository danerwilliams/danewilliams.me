<p>Recently I was looking up some java documentation as I have not worked with the language since my AP CS class sophomore year of high school, and ended up coming across an exciting surprise!</p>
<p><img src="https://www.danewilliams.me/images/foobar1.jpg" alt="foobar1"></p>
<p>Intrigued, I proceeded by clicking the button &ldquo;I want to play&rdquo;, and discovered the Google FooBar challenge!
Clicking the button led me to a terminal in the browser with some instructions, which allows for your to request different coding challenges which can be solved in python 2 (no python 3 :-/ ) or in java.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.danewilliams.me/images/foobar2.jpg" alt="foobar2"></p>
<p>Previously I had never heard of FooBar, so I did some research to learn a bit more.
Basically this is being used as a recruiting tool at Google to identify developers by monitoring people&rsquo;s Google searches.
In my case, I had been doing a bunch of searches related to Java when the FooBar invite appeared.
Presumably, Google had built in some sort of algorithm to their search which notices certain search terms being used and eventually offers up an invite to FooBar once certain developer related terms had been searched frequently enough.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>From the FooBar terminal you can requests different programming challenges.
There are 5 levels, each containing multiple challenges.
I&rsquo;ve only completed the first challenge so far, which I was given 48 hours to complete after opening.
It was fairly simple, and the skills I learned from my <a href="https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.34872.su20/">programming challenges</a> course at Notre Dame were great preparation.
Once you pass level 3 my understanding is that a Google recruiter will reach out to you for an actual interview, so my goal is to get through those challenges some time soon!</p>
