<p>I will try to update this page as I complete new projects, however the most up to date location of all my projects is of course my <a href="https://github.com/danerwilliams">github</a>. I also have a <a href="https://gitlab.com/dwilli36">gitlab</a>, but so far I only have used this for my classes at Notre Dame that submit assignments through private gitlab repos. A list of my projects in reverse chronological order is below.</p>
<h2 id="danewilliamsme-this-website">danewilliams.me (this website!)</h2>
<ul>
<li>March 2020</li>
<li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/danerwilliams/danewilliams.me">danewilliams.me</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I made this website with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">hugo</a> and hosted it with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a>. I highly recommend both hugo and github pages as setting this all up was stupid fast and simple.</p>

<li>March 2020</li>
<li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/danerwilliams/tmux-dracula">tmux-dracula</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I am a huge fan of the <a href="https://draculatheme.com/">dracula theme</a> and use it for vim, terminal.app, slack, and vs code. The only thing missing for me to have an all dracula set up was a theme for tmux. There are some floating around github, but most of them use powerline which I was not really interested in and I found my self unsatisfied with the options that already existed. With the extra time I had while classes are online due to COVID-19, I took it upon myself to make an all in one, plug and play tmux extension folowing the dracula color scheme! I built the extension with bash scripts that gather the information I desired to be in the status bar. I have a script for gathering the current network SSID and another script for the battery percentage and charging status which are pretty much simple Unix pipelines. Additionally, there is a script for fetching the current location from an api, and then using that information to scrape the current weather off the internet. This script runs in a wrapper that updates the weather information every 1000 seconds.</p>

</ul>
<p>This was my final project for CSE 20221 logic design, which I took during the Fall 2019 semester with Professor Siddharth Joshi. For the project, my partner, <a href="https://github.com/billyporter">Billy Porter</a>, and I built a high level state machine with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog">verilog</a>, a hardware description language. Our HLSM powered a Pacman inspired game which could be played with a keyboard and displayed on a VGA.</p>
<h2 id="fisher-hall-website">fisher-hall-website</h2>
<ul>
<li>May 2019</li>
<li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/danerwilliams/fisher-hall-website">fisher-hall-website</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For the 2019-2020 school year I was appointed website commissioner for Fisher hall at Notre Dame by our hall president and vice president. I completely rebuilt the website from the ground up as an SPA in angularJS. This is the first time I have done anything with a front end before, so it was an interesting project to get introduced to HTML and CSS, which I used in addition to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. Moving forward Fisher&rsquo;s website responsibilities have been passed on to another fellow CS major in Fisher hall, <a href="https://github.com/antithalian">John Sullivan</a>.</p>
<h2 id="elo-tennis-predictor">elo-tennis-predictor</h2>
<ul>
<li>April 2019</li>
<li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/danerwilliams/elo-tennis-predictor">elo-tennis-predictor</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This was my final project for CSE 10112 Intro to Engineering II. Myself along with my group members <a href="https://github.com/billyporter">Billy Porter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jheneghan16">Jamie Heneghan</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mpitz1">Michael Pitz</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-dillane-382448194/">Matt Dillane</a> built a <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html">MATLAB</a> model with a GUI which predicts <a href="https://www.atptour.com/">ATP tennis</a> match results using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">ELO algorithms</a>. Our GUI interface allowed the user to recieve betting recommendations based on the odds given by Vegas.</p>
<h2 id="ec-ar-testing-form">EC-AR-Testing-Form</h2>
<ul>
<li>May 2017</li>
<li>Github: <a href="https://github.com/danerwilliams/EC-AR-Testing-Form">EC-AR-Testing-Form</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This is the first real development project I have ever worked on. The goal of the project was to develop a web app which allowed students with testing accomodations at my high school to log in with their school Outlook account, and then schedule exams by filling out a form which would automatically update the test proctors Outlook calendar. I built the web app during my junior year of high school, with my only previous coding experience having been the AP Computer Science class which I took during my sophomore year through be the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/teals">TEALS</a> program at Eastside Catholic School. In hindsight, it was not well built (don&rsquo;t judge my code lol) as I had much to learn at the time. Probably the biggest mistake was choosing to create the app with JSP and Java, which I found appealing because Java was the only programming language I knew back then. Picking up node.js or django + python probaby would&rsquo;ve been much more effective for interacting with REST API&rsquo;s and deploying to AWS in the long run.</p>
