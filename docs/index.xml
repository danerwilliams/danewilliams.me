      <description>Discovery Recently I was looking up some java documentation as I have not worked with the language since my AP CS class sophomore year of high school, and ended up coming across an exciting surprise!
Intrigued, I proceeded by clicking the button &amp;ldquo;I want to play&amp;rdquo;, and discovered the Google FooBar challenge! Clicking the button led me to a terminal in the browser with some instructions, which allows for your to request different coding challenges which can be solved in python 2 (no python 3 :/ ) or in java.</description>

      <description>Hugo Website Tutorial Recently my younger brother who is in high school and is beginning to learn more about programming expressed interest in building his own portfolio site, similar to this one. I figured I would help him out by making a tutorial for complete beginners.
This is an all inclusive tutorial on how to make a static personal site using the Hugo framework. Experience with command line, git, markdown, etc.</description>

      <title>Building an AI chatbot</title>

      <description>Introduction In the Notre Dame CSE slack we have a bot named bobbit which performs many commands providing a lot of entertainment and functionality. I decided that it could be fun to build my own bot for use in my water polo team groupme so that we could easily get information about tournament schedules, pool time openings, etc. This led me down a rabbit hole of python bots where I eventually discovered ChatterBot, a machine learning conversational dialog engine for chatbots.</description>

      <title>Having fun with zig lang</title>

      <description>Introduction Some fellow Notre Dame CS students made the awesome pbui-project, the POSIX-compliant BSD/Linux Userland Implementation, which is a userland implementation written entirely in zig. Out of curiosity for trying out zig I decided to make a small pull request implementing the pwd command.
Thoughts on Zig Since I had next to no background knowledge on zig programming, there was a lot less time coding and a lot more time spent reading documentation.</description>

      <title>Developing an http web server in C</title>

      <description>Introduction As the final project for my systems programming class at Notre Dame my partner, Conor Murphy, and I developed a simple http web server server (similar to apache). We did this entirely in C, which was a great opportunity to learn about networking specific issues such as commication over sockets, as well as low level functions and system calls for memory allocation and file/directory manipulation.
Development I&amp;rsquo;ll spare the details here but the development process for this was very reading heavy.</description>

      <title>My first open source contribution! (dracula/tmux)</title>

      <description>Introduction Recently I have begun using the awesome dracula theme for most of my development tools. Unfortunately, one of my favorite tools, tmux did not have a dracula theme (until now).
Methodology A couple weeks ago, towards the beginning of corona virus quarantine here in the Bay Area, I decided to take it upon myself to develop a dracula theme extension for tmux while I had a bit of extra time due to Notre Dame going online.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my blog! I plan to use this site to share my projects and code with the world, and may occasionally speak to other interests of mine. I am currently a CS student at Notre Dame, and you can learn more about me by checking out my about page.</description>

      <description>I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Notre Dame graduating in 2022. Outside of my studies I spend much of my time at the pool playing for the Notre Dame men&amp;rsquo;s water polo team. Originally, I am from the Bellevue/Eastside area of Seattle, where I attended Eastside Catholic School and graduated in 2018. I am also a proud alumni of the Bellevue Club Swim Team. Since leaving for college my family moved to the Bay Area so that is where I reside while on breaks.</description>

      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;ve Been Working On I will try to update this page as I complete new projects, however the most up to date location of all my projects is of course my github. I also have a gitlab, but so far I only have used this for my classes at Notre Dame that submit assignments through private gitlab repos. A list of my projects in reverse chronological order is below.</description>
