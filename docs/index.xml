      <description>Introduction For those of you who know me well, you would realize that I use the awesome dracula theme for pretty much every development tool I use. Unfourtunately, one of my favorite tools, tmux did not have a dracula theme (until now). Much to my surprise, the founder of dracula asked me to transfer my theme to the official dracula organization, and I am now the maintainer of the github repo, which makes this my first ever open source contribution!</description>

      <description>I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Notre Dame graduating in 2022. Outside of my studies I spend much of my time at the pool playing for the Notre Dame men&amp;rsquo;s water polo team. Originally, I am from the Bellevue/Eastside area of Seattle, where I attended Eastside Catholic School and graduated in 2018. I am also a proud alumni of the Bellevue Club Swim Team. Since leaving for college my family moved to the Bay Area so that is where I reside while on breaks.</description>

      <description>What I&amp;rsquo;ve Been Working On I will try to update this page as I complete new projects, however the most up to date location of all my projects is of course my github. I also have a gitlab, but so far I only have used this for my classes at Notre Dame that submit assignments through private gitlab repos. A list of my projects in reverse chronological order is below.</description>
