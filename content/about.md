I am an undergraduate [computer science](https://cse.nd.edu/) student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) graduating in 2022. Outside of my studies I spend much of my time at the pool playing for the Notre Dame [men's water polo team](http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/). Originally, I am from the Bellevue/Eastside area of Seattle, where I attended [Eastside Catholic School](https://www.eastsidecatholic.org/) and graduated in 2018. I am also a proud alumni of the [Bellevue Club Swim Team](https://www.teamunify.com/team/onsbcst/page/home). Since leaving for college my family moved to the Bay Area so that is where I reside while on breaks. While at Notre Dame I live in [Fisher Hall](https://fisher.nd.edu/#/). 


## Interests

* Apple: I'm a huge Apple fan and am a macbook, iphone, and ipad pro user. In 2015 I also built a [hackintosh](https://www.tonymacx86.com/).
