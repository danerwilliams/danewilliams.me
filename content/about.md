I am an undergraduate [computer science](https://cse.nd.edu/) student at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) graduating in 2022. Outside of my studies I spend much of my time at the pool playing for the Notre Dame [men's water polo team](http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/). Originally, I am from the Bellevue/Eastside area of Seattle, where I attended [Eastside Catholic School](https://www.eastsidecatholic.org/) and graduated in 2018. I am also a proud alumni of the [Bellevue Club Swim Team](https://www.teamunify.com/team/onsbcst/page/home). Since leaving for college my family moved to the Bay Area so that is where I reside while on breaks. While at Notre Dame I live in [Fisher Hall](https://fisher.nd.edu/#/), and spend much of my time in room B010 (better known as coder quad) working on school work and other CS projects. 


## Interests
I have many interests both related and unrelated to my studies: 

### Tech
* Apple: I'm a huge Apple fan and am a macbook, iphone, and ipad pro user. In 2015 I also built a [hackintosh](https://www.tonymacx86.com/).
* Linux/Unix: My [systems programming](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp20/) class at Notre Dame introduced me to Linux/Unix concepts and tools. 
	- Try to work more with Linux by getting involved in [ND Linux Users Group](https://ndlug.org/)
	- Running a raspberry pi desktop with [manjaro xfce](https://manjaro.org/download/#raspberry-pi-4-xfce)
	- I am a contributor and maintainer for the [dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/tmux)

### Sports
* Water Polo: I play for Notre Dame and follow the US national team
* Swimming: I keep up with NCAA, US national, and international swimming
* College Football: Obviously a fan of ND football
* NFL: I am a huge Seahawks fan and look forward to Pete Carroll, Russell Wilson, and John Schneider leading us to another Super Bowl victory.
* NBA: Not as important to me as the hawks but I do consider myself a Lakers fan.

### Other
Outside of my primary interests in technology and sports, I do have other interests to fill the remainder of my time.
