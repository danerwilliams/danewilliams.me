Hey there 👋

I'm a 2022 [Notre Dame](https://nd.edu) computer science alum. (Go Irish! ☘️) 
While at Notre Dame I was a proud resident of [Fisher Hall](https://fisher.nd.edu/#/) and also played on the [water polo team](http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/). 

Originally I grew up in Seattle and graduated from [Eastside Catholic School](https://www.eastsidecatholic.org/).
Now I work remotely and plan to spend most of my time in New York City and Southern California.

Most areas of software engineering are intriguing to me, but I am particularly interested in full stack development, cloud engineering, and open source.
I am driven by my own curiosity and eagerness to learn, as well as a desire to have an impact on the organizations I work with.
