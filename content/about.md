I am computer science major at [Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) graduating in 2022. 
Outside of my studies I am a part of the [club water polo team](http://sites.nd.edu/waterpolo/) and live in [Fisher Hall](https://fisher.nd.edu/#/). 
Before college I grew up in the Seattle area, where I graduated from [Eastside Catholic School](https://www.eastsidecatholic.org/) and swam for [BCST](https://www.teamunify.com/team/onsbcst/page/home).


## Interests

#### Tech
* I'm a huge Apple fan and am a macbook, iphone, and ipad pro user. 
* In 2015 I also built a [hackintosh](https://www.tonymacx86.com/), but will probably convert this to a Linux server.
* Some of my favorite classes at ND are [systems programming](https://www3.nd.edu/~pbui/teaching/cse.20289.sp20/) and [compilers](https://www3.nd.edu/~dthain/compilerbook/).
* I am a contributor and maintainer for the [dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/tmux).

#### Sports
* College Football: Obviously a fan of ND football
* NFL: Go Hawks!
* NBA: Somewhat of a Lakers fan
* NHL: Excited about the Seattle Kraken expansion team

* Into Thin Air, Jon Krakauer
* Gold in The Water, P.H. Mullen
