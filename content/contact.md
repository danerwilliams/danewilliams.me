# Get In Touch
Feel free to get in touch with me!

Email: dane_williams@outlook.com

I am happy to talk about projects or anything for that matter. Please note that the email I have provided is my personal email which I don't always check regularly. Normally, I respond to emails within a couple of days, but it's always possible that you catch me during midterms week and I am a bit slower.


# Recruiters
If you are a recruiter/employer, you can view my resume at this [github repo](https://github.com/danerwilliams/resume/blob/master/DaneWilliamsResume.pdf), where appropriate contact information is available.
